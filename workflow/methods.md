To identify potential cellular targets of the Coxsackievirus B3 3Cpro and 2Apro proteases, we designed a computational workflow (Fig. 7) based on two different datasets: the database sequence alignments and the DMS sequences. First of all, we carried out a fine-tuning, consisting of: a trimming analysis to obtain the optimal length of the peptide sequences of the cleavage sites and an analysis of the score methods to select the most suitable PSSM construction method according to our sequences. Once the PSSMSearch settings have been optimised, the output files are obtained and finally filtered.
